# README for CardioVisible

## Overview

Welcome to my experimental app project, where I delve into the exciting capabilities of HealthKit and RealityKit! CardioVisible is a playful exploration, serving as a testing ground for these powerful frameworks. It's important to note that this app is intended for experimenting with and understanding the functionalities of HealthKit and RealityKit in a fun and engaging manner.

## Features

CardioVisible includes several features that showcase the integration and capabilities of HealthKit and RealityKit:

1. **HealthKit Integration**: The app fetches and displays health data, such as heart rate and walking/running distances, from HealthKit. It provides an interactive way to visualize your physical activities.

2. **RealityKit Experimentation**: Using RealityKit, the app features a 3D model of the Heart, a running figure, and Earth. The model is displayed with augmented reality, offering a unique visual experience.
